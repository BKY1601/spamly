# spamly
The Spamly Streamlit app uses a machine learning model to classify SMS messages as Spam or Ham (Not Spam). It’s built using Python, scikit-learn, and Streamlit. Users can enter a message, and the app will instantly predict whether it's a spam message or not using a Naive Bayes classifier trained on TF-IDF features.
